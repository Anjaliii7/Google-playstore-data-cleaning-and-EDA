# ðŸ“± Google Play Store Dataset - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the **Google Play Store Dataset**.  
This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of key insights about apps on the Play Store.

## ðŸ“‘ Dataset Overview
| Column Name        | Description                                                                                                        |

| **Size**           | Size of the app (e.g., `14M` for 14 MB, `8.7M` for 8.7 MB, `Varies with device` if size is unspecified).           |
| **Installs**       | Total number of times the app has been installed by users (e.g., `1,000+`, `5,000,000+`).                          |

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
##  Data Cleaning Process

- **Converted `Reviews` column**:
  - Replaced unimportant symbols like `:`, `,`, `.`.
  - Replaced invalid entries with `NaN` and dropped them.
  - Converted valid values to `int`.
  
- **Cleaned `Size`, `Installs`, and `Price` columns**:
  - Removed extra characters like `M`, `k`, `$`, `+`, `,`.
  - Converted invalid entries to `NaN`.
  - Dropped invalid records and converted cleaned values to appropriate numeric types (`int` or `float`).

- **Modified `Last Updated` column**:
  - Extracted `Date`, `Month`, and `Year` into separate new columns for detailed temporal analysis.

- **Checked for duplicate rows and dropped them.**

- **Checked number of numerical and categorical columns** using `df.dtypes` and classified them.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process

- **Drew a KDE Plot** to visualize the distribution (proportion of count) for all numerical features.
- **Created a Countplot** to show the distribution of counts across all categorical features.
- **Plotted a Pie Chart** to visualize which app categories are widely present and popular in the Play Store.
- **Created a Bar Chart** displaying the **Top 10 App Categories** based on app count.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualizations

- ðŸ“Š Proportion of numerical features (KDE Plot) - Rating and Year are left skewed.Reviews, size , installs and price are right skewed - Most apps on playstore are free.
- ðŸ“Š Proportion of categorical features (Countplot)
- ðŸ“Š Pie chart of app categories by count - there are more kinds of apps in playstore which are      under category of family , games and tools. Beauty , comics, arts and weather kind of apps        are very less in playstore
- ðŸ“Š Bar chart for Top 10 app categories - family category has the most number of apps followed       by games category . least number of apps belong to beauty category
